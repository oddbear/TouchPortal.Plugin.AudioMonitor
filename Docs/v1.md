# Version 1

This plugin can be used to monitor your Audio Input Device in TouchPortal.
This plugin is in a **early stage**, and are still under testing.

Right now we only support Input devices like Microphones.<br />
The monitor is made to be similar to what you see on the GoXLR Fader Meter, and the Audacity monitor.
